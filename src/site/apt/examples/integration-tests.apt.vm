Integration tests

  The aim here is to combine the usage of the <<<cassandra-maven-plugin>>> with the <<<maven-failsafe-plugin>>> to
  allow the integration tests to be run against a test instance of Apache Cassandra. The developer does not have to manually
  install Cassandra.

  First we need to modify the <<<pom.xml>>> to reference both <<<cassandra-maven-plugin>>> and the
  <<<maven-failsafe-plugin>>>

  This will result in the following mojos being executed during the lifecycle as follows:

*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| <<Phase>>             | <<Goal(s)>>                     |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| pre-integration-test  | cassandra:start                 |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| integration-test      | failsafe:integration-test       |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| post-integration-test | cassandra:stop                  |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+
| verify                | failsafe:verify                 |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+

  If you want the tests to be more independent, you can leverage the <<<build-helper-maven-plugin>>> to allocate
  random ports to your tests, thereby ensuring that the tests don't fail if a port is in use, and allowing, e.g.
  parallel builds on a build server.

  For example (Note this example assumes you use resource filtering to pass the cassandra ports through to the tests,
  you could also pass them through as system properties by configuring <<<maven-failsafe-plugin>>>):

* Local clusters

  To use a local cluster, you just change the <<<start>>> and <<<stop>>> goals to <<<start-cluster>>> and
  <<<stop-cluster>>> respectively.

  Note: On OS-X you will need to enable the local loop back aliases before you can run a cluster. One way to do this
  is to use the command

---
ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2
---

  These aliases are not persisted across reboots.

* Port usage

  As well as the standard Cassandra ports, the Maven plugin also opens a stop port (defaults to 8081) in order to allow
  the Cassandra service(s) to be shut down cleanly.  If the default stop port is used by your tests, or is already in
  use on your system then you might need to change that default.

  The best designed builds will use something like
  {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/reserve-network-port-mojo.html}build-helper:reserve-network-port}}
  to allocate ports.

* Multi JVM use

 To use JDK8 with Cassandra Server 3.x in combination with Failsafe integration tests you need to use Toolchains.
 First we need to configure some Toolchains with Maven. Making the more recent the default for your project. See the
 {{{https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html}Toolchains Plugin}} for instructions.

 Additionally add another execution to Toolchains. To set JDK8 during the maven-failsafe-plugin pre-integration-test phase

---
<plugin>
 <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
 <artifactId>maven-toolchains-plugin</artifactId>
 <version>3.0.0</version>
 <executions>
   <execution>
     <id>default-pre-integration-test</id>
     <phase>pre-integration-test</phase>
     <goals>
       <goal>toolchain</goal>
     </goals>
     <configuration>
       <toolchains>
         <jdk>
           <version>1.8</version>
           <vendor>OpenJDK</vendor>
         </jdk>
       </toolchains>
     </configuration>
   </execution>
 </executions>
</plugin>
---

 Finally override the toolchain assigned during pre-integration-test phase. So that the integration-test phase executes with
 the intended more recent JDK.

---
<plugin>
 <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
 <configuration>
   <jvm>/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk/bin/java</jvm>
 </configuration>
</plugin>
---

 This will result in the following during the lifecycle

*-----------------------+---------------------------------+---------+
| <<Phase>>             | <<Goal(s)>>                     | <<JDK>> |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+---------+
| pre-integration-test  | cassandra:start                 | 8       |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+---------+
| integration-test      | failsafe:integration-test       | 11      |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+---------+
| post-integration-test | cassandra:stop                  | 8       |
*-----------------------+---------------------------------+---------+
| verify                | failsafe:verify                 | 11      |
