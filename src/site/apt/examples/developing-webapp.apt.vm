Developing a web application

  The aim here is to combine the usage of the <<<cassandra-maven-plugin>>> with the <<<jetty-maven-plugin>>> to make
  development testing of the web application a lot easier. The developer does not have to manually install either
  Apache Cassandra or a Servlet container.

  Note: the following examples assume you have put a reference to both <<<cassandra-maven-plugin>>> and
  <<<jetty-maven-plugin>>> into your <<<pom.xml>>>, e.g. for <<<cassandra-maven-plugin>>> you would add the following:

---
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>cassandra-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${pluginVersion}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
---

  If you cannot modify the <<<pom.xml>>> then you will have to specify the full coordinates for the goals, i.e.
  in stead of calling <<<cassandra:start>>> you would have to call
  <<<org.apache.cassandra:cassandra-maven-plugin:${pluginVersion}:start>>>.

  The only issue out of the starting blocks is that both <<<jetty>>> and <<<cassandra>>> want to use port 8080.
  From the command line, we can get almost all that we want from a simple

---
mvn cassandra:start jetty:run -Dcassandra.jmxPort=18080
---

  Or

---
mvn cassandra:start jetty:run -Djetty.port=8000
---

  If the web application is expecting keyspaces to be defined, we can use a <<<cassandra-cli>>> script to create the
  keyspaces for us. We create a file called <<<src/cassandra/cli/load.script>>>

---
mvn cassandra:start cassandra:load jetty:run -Djetty.port=8000
---

  Thereafter we can skip the <<<cassandra:load>>> unless we run <<<mvn clean>>>

  If we actually want to wipe all the data between Maven runs, we would use:

---
mvn cassandra:delete cassandra:start cassandra:load jetty:run -Djetty.port=8000
---
