cluster_name: 'Test Cluster'

# You should always specify InitialToken when setting up a production
# cluster for the first time, and often when adding capacity later.
# The principle is that each node should be given an equal slice of
# the token ring; see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations
# for more details.
#
# If blank, Cassandra will request a token bisecting the range of
# the heaviest-loaded existing node.  If there is no load information
# available, such as is the case with a new cluster, it will pick
# a random token, which will lead to hot spots.
initial_token:

# Set to true to make new [non-seed] nodes automatically migrate data
# to themselves from the pre-existing nodes in the cluster.  Defaults
# to false because you can only bootstrap N machines at a time from
# an existing cluster of N, so if you are bringing up a cluster of
# 10 machines with 3 seeds you would have to do it in stages.  Leaving
# this off for the initial start simplifies that.

# Unlike most systems, in Cassandra writes are faster than reads, so

# request_scheduler -- Set this to a class that implements

# not affect inter node communication.
# org.apache.cassandra.scheduler.NoScheduler - No scheduling takes place

# request_scheduler_options as described below.
request_scheduler: org.apache.cassandra.scheduler.NoScheduler

# Scheduler Options vary based on the type of scheduler
# NoScheduler - Has no options
# RoundRobin
#  - throttle_limit -- The throttle_limit is the number of in-flight
#                      requests per client.  Requests beyond
#                      that limit are queued up until

#                      The value of 80 here is twice the number of

#  - default_weight -- default_weight is optional and allows for
#                      overriding the default which is 1.
#  - weights -- Weights are optional and will default to 1 or the
#               overridden default_weight. The weight translates into how
#               many requests are handled during each turn of the
#               RoundRobin, based on the scheduler id.
